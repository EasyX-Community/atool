# atool - Admin Tool Scripts

These scripts are meant to perform common administrative tasks, such as clearing log files or upgrading the system.

**- install-scripts.sh -** Install and configure the scripts<br />
**- atool-clearlogs -** Truncates all log files (empties log files)<br />
**- atool-upgradesystem -** Upgrades System - add '-y' at the end to force upgrade<br />

I will add more scripts later if I can make more useful ones.
