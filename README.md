Admin Tool Scripts

**- install-scripts.sh -** Install and configure the scripts<br />
**- atool-clearlogs -** Truncates all log files (empties log files)
**- energi3-upgrade-system -** Upgrades System - add '-y' at the end to force upgrade<br />

These scripts are to help with starting, maintaining, and checking on the status of your NRG / Energi masternode.

**I will add more scripts later if I can make more useful ones.**
